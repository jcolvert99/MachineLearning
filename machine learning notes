machine learning- subfield of AI
    -uses algorithms and statistical models to predict outcome
    -relies on patterns and inferences from historical data, does not need explicit instructions

how its being used:
    -weather forecasting, medical research, investment forecasting

scikit-learn library- offers machine learning algorithms as packages (called estimators)
    -used to create predictive models for data analytics

types of machine learning
    -supervised ML- works with labeled data
        -training model to recognize objects that are labeled so it can classify the objects
        -train your ML models on datasets that consist of rows and columns
            -rows are called "samples"
            -columns are called "features" of that sample
            -each sample has an associated label called a target (value you want your model to predict for new data presented)
        -classification models- predict the discrete classes to which samples belong
            -binary classification- 2 classes (ex- email is spam or non-spam)
            -multi-classification-
        -regression models- continuous output
            -linearregression estimator uses all numerical features in a dataset to make sophisticated predictions
    -unsupervised ML- works with unlabeled data
        -uses the training under supervised to classify objects
        -no "target" value- uses a clustering algorithm- finds similarities and groups similar data points together
            -uses dimensionality reduction- compress multiple features into a few key features

steps of data science study
    -load data
    -explore data with pandas and visualizations
    -transofrm data (numeric to non-numeric)
    -split the data (training and testint)
    -create model
    -test model
    -tune model
    -use model to make predictions on new data

    -digits.data
    -digits.target
    -digits.images
